Creationism is a religious belief that asserts the universe, Earth, and all living organisms were created by a divine being, usually referred to as God. This concept stands in contrast to scientific explanations such as evolutionary theory which rely on natural processes and empirical evidence.

## Overview

Creationism posits that the origin of the universe and its inhabitants are the result of deliberate and purposeful acts of a higher power rather than being a product of chance or natural selection. Advocates of creationism argue that religious texts, such as the biblical account of creation in Genesis, provide an accurate and literal description of how life on Earth came into existence.

The specific beliefs within Creationism can vary significantly depending on the religious tradition and interpretation of the creation narrative. Some adherents may endorse Young Earth Creationism, which holds that the Earth and the universe are only a few thousand years old. Others may support Old Earth Creationism, which allows for a significantly longer period since the creation.

## Types of Creationism

### Young Earth Creationism

Young Earth Creationism asserts that the Earth was created by God within the last 10,000 years. This view is based on a literal interpretation of the creation account in the book of Genesis. Young Earth Creationists often reject scientific findings that contradict this view, including radiometric dating and the fossil record.

### Old Earth Creationism

Old Earth Creationism accepts the scientific evidence for the age of the Earth and the universe but maintains that God was directly involved in the process of creation. This viewpoint interprets the "days" mentioned in the Genesis creation narrative as longer periods, allowing for alignment with scientific findings. Old Earth Creationists often accept aspects of evolutionary theory while believing that God guided the process.

### Intelligent Design

Intelligent Design (ID) is a modern form of creationism that argues the complexity of living organisms cannot be explained solely through natural processes and must involve an intelligent designer. ID proponents often assert that certain features of the universe and biological systems show evidence of design and purpose, suggesting the involvement of a higher power.

## Criticism

Creationism has faced criticism from various scientific communities and mainstream academia. Critics argue that creationist claims lack empirical evidence and do not adhere to the scientific method. They object to the teaching of creationism in public schools as it does not meet the criteria of scientific theory required to be included in the science curriculum.

Creationism has particularly been at odds with the theory of evolution, which is regarded as one of the foundations of modern biology. The scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the theory of evolution as a well-substantiated explanation for biological diversity based on abundant evidence from multiple scientific disciplines.

## Legal and Educational Controversies

The teaching of creationism in public schools has been a subject of legal and educational controversy in several countries. Many courts have ruled that teaching creationism in science classrooms violates the principle of separation of church and state. In the United States, the Supreme Court case Edwards v. Aguillard (1987) ruled that teaching creationism alongside evolution is unconstitutional.

Despite legal challenges and scientific opposition, creationism remains a significant belief system among certain religious communities worldwide. Individuals and organizations continue to promote and advocate for the inclusion of creationism in educational settings.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women's rights movement. She played a groundbreaking role in advocating for women's rights, especially women's suffrage, during the 19th century.

## Early Life and Education

Elizabeth Cady Stanton was born on November 12, 1815, in Johnstown, New York, to Daniel Cady and Margaret Livingston Cady. Her father, Daniel Cady, was a prominent lawyer and judge. Growing up in a politically engaged household, Elizabeth developed a keen interest in social justice and women's rights from an early age.

After completing her education at Emma Willard's Troy Female Seminary, Stanton went on to study law with her father's encouragement. However, due to societal norms and restrictions placed on women during that time, she was not allowed to practice law or even attend law school.

## Women's Rights Activism

Stanton's involvement in the women's rights movement began in 1840 when she attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London with her husband, Henry Brewster Stanton. At the convention, she was outraged by the fact that women were not allowed to actively participate or speak. This experience motivated her to dedicate her life to fighting for women's rights.

In 1848, Stanton organized the Seneca Falls Convention, along with Lucretia Mott, which is widely recognized as the birth of the women's rights movement in the United States. At the convention, Stanton presented the Declaration of Sentiments, a groundbreaking document that called for women's suffrage and advocated for women's equality in various aspects of society.

Throughout her career, Stanton worked closely with Susan B. Anthony, forming a powerful partnership that proved instrumental in advancing women's suffrage. Together, they co-founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869, which focused on securing the right to vote for women through federal constitutional amendments.

## Legacy

Elizabeth Cady Stanton left a lasting legacy as a pioneer of the women's rights movement. Her tireless efforts and powerful advocacy played a crucial role in gaining women the right to vote. Her decades-long work paved the way for the eventual passage of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, which granted women suffrage.

Stanton's writings and speeches remain influential and are considered significant contributions to feminist thought. Her most notable works include "The Woman's Bible," published in two volumes in the late 19th century, and "Eighty Years and More: Reminiscences 1815–1897," an autobiography published in 1898.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton passed away on October 26, 1902, in New York City. Today, she is remembered as one of the foremost leaders of the women's rights movement, whose activism and perseverance continue to inspire future generations.

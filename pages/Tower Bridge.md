Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge located in London, England. It spans the River Thames, connecting the boroughs of City of London and Tower Hamlets. Recognized as an iconic symbol of London, the bridge is one of the city's most visited landmarks.

## History

Construction of Tower Bridge began in 1886 and was completed in 1894. It was designed by Sir Horace Jones and Sir John Wolfe Barry, with contributions from engineer Sir William Arrol. The bridge was constructed to relieve increasing traffic congestion in the vicinity of the City of London, specifically around the nearby London Bridge.

## Design and Architecture

Tower Bridge is a unique combination of a suspension bridge and a bascule (drawbridge). The bridge consists of two towers, each standing 65 meters (213 feet) tall, with a central bascule span of 61 meters (200 feet) and two side suspension spans of 82 meters (269 feet) each. The bascules are operated by hydraulics systems, enabling them to be raised and lowered to allow river traffic to pass.

The architectural style of Tower Bridge reflects Victorian Gothic Revival, with its neo-Gothic towers and intricate detailing. The bridge is constructed using steel, which was considered a modern material at the time of its construction.

## Functionality

Tower Bridge serves as both a road and a pedestrian bridge. It provides a vital transportation link between the northern and southern parts of the city. The bridge is crossed by approximately 40,000 people every day, along with numerous vehicles. While it used to be manually operated, today it is controlled automatically. The bridge raises around 800 times annually to let large vessels pass through.

## Cultural Significance

Tower Bridge has become an iconic symbol of London and is widely recognized around the world. It has featured in numerous films, television shows, and photographs, becoming synonymous with the city's identity. The bridge is also an important part of London's New Year's Eve celebrations, as fireworks are often launched from it at midnight.

## Tower Bridge Exhibition

Visitors can explore the bridge's history and architectural marvel through the Tower Bridge Exhibition. The exhibition is housed within the bridge's twin towers and provides insights into the structure, including its construction, engineering, and operation. Additionally, visitors can access the high-level walkways, offering panoramic views of London's skyline.

Elizabeth Anscombe (March 18, 1919 â€“ January 5, 2001) was a British philosopher well-known for her work in philosophy of mind, ethics, and moral philosophy. She was born in Limerick, Ireland, and later became a naturalized British citizen. Anscombe was a prominent figure in the analytic philosophy movement and played a crucial role in revitalizing virtues ethics.

## Early Life and Education

Elizabeth Anscombe was born as Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe on March 18, 1919, in Limerick, Ireland. She was the daughter of Allen Anscombe, a solicitor, and Gertrude Anscombe. Anscombe attended Sydenham High School in London and later studied philosophy and classics at St. Hugh's College, Oxford. She studied under influential philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and studied philosophy of mind, ethics, and logic.

## Career and Contributions

Anscombe's work made significant contributions across different areas of philosophy, especially in moral philosophy. She argued against consequentialism and defended the concept of virtue ethics, which gained renewed interest in the late 20th century. Anscombe's groundbreaking paper, "Modern Moral Philosophy" (1958), criticized the modern moral theories' focus on moral obligation and highlighted the importance of character and virtues in ethical decision-making.

Apart from moral philosophy, Anscombe also made important contributions to philosophy of mind and action. Her work on intention and practical knowledge has been highly influential. In her book "Intention" (1957), she explored the connection between intention and action, challenging prevailing theories on the subject.

Anscombe was a strong advocate for Catholic teachings in moral philosophy, and her religious beliefs influenced her work. She defended positions in line with Catholic doctrine on issues such as contraception and abortion, which generated both praise and controversy for her work.

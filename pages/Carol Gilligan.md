Carol Gilligan is an American feminist psychologist, author, and educator known for her groundbreaking work in gender studies and moral development. Born on November 28, 1936, in New York City, Gilligan has made significant contributions to the field of psychology with her research on gender differences and women's voices in society.

## Background and Education

Gilligan was raised in a Jewish family in New York City. She completed her undergraduate studies at Swarthmore College, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature. Gilligan later pursued her graduate studies at Radcliffe College, where she obtained her Master's degree in clinical psychology. She went on to earn her Ph.D. in social psychology from Harvard University.

## Career and Research

Gilligan's influential research challenged the predominant theories of Lawrence Kohlberg on moral development, which focused mainly on male perspectives. Her groundbreaking book, *In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development*, published in 1982, presented an alternative perspective on moral reasoning that highlighted the essential role of relationships and caring for others.

She argued that traditional approaches to moral development failed to capture the unique voice and moral concerns of women. According to Gilligan, women tend to emphasize empathy, relationships, and care in their moral decision-making, contrasting with the emphasis on justice and individual rights often found in conventional theories.

Gilligan's work greatly influenced feminist theory and gender studies. Her research shed light on the experiences of women and their unique contributions to society. She advocated for a more inclusive and holistic approach to understanding morality, one that incorporates both male and female perspectives.

## Achievements and Awards

Gilligan's work has received widespread recognition and acclaim. She has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the Grawemeyer Award for Education, the Heinz Award for Human Condition, and the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic.

## Notable Publications

In addition to her seminal work *In a Different Voice*, Gilligan has authored and co-authored several books that have made significant contributions to the fields of psychology, gender studies, and ethics. Some of her notable publications include:

- *Joining the Resistance* (2011)
- *The Birth of Pleasure* (2002)
- *Mapping the Moral Domain: A Contribution of Women's Thinking to Psychological Theory and Education* (1988)

## Legacy and Influence

Gilligan's research and ideas have had a lasting impact on various disciplines, including psychology, philosophy, and gender studies. Her emphasis on empathy, relationships, and care as integral to moral decision-making has broadened the understanding of morality and ethics.

Her work has inspired generations of scholars, researchers, and activists to explore the complexities of gender and morality, and to challenge established norms and biases. Gilligan's ideas continue to shape discussions on feminist theory, ethical development, and the role of care in society.

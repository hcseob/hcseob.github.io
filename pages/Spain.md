Spain, officially known as the Kingdom of Spain, is a country located in Southern Europe. It occupies the majority of the Iberian Peninsula and shares its borders with Portugal to the west, France and Andorra to the northeast, and Gibraltar to the south. With a population of over 46 million people, Spain is the sixth-largest country in Europe by area.

## History

Spain has a rich and complex history dating back to prehistoric times, with various distinct cultures and civilizations leaving their mark on the region. The country was conquered by the Romans in the 2nd century BC and later fell under the influence of the Visigoths and Moors during the medieval period. The unification of Spain as a single entity took place in 1469 when Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon married, establishing a powerful Christian kingdom.

During the Early Modern Period, Spain became one of the world's first global empires, thanks to its exploration and colonization efforts. Spanish explorers played a significant role in the discovery of the Americas, leading to the establishment of vast colonial territories throughout the Americas, Asia, and Africa. This period, known as the Spanish Golden Age, witnessed extensive cultural, economic, and political influence on a global scale.

Spain experienced a series of political and economic difficulties throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Napoleonic Wars, the loss of its colonies, and the Spanish Civil War. However, Spain emerged from these challenges and transitioned into a democratic constitutional monarchy in 1978.

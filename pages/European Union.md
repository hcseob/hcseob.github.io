The **European Union (EU)** is a political and economic union of 27 member states located in Europe. It was established by the **Maastricht Treaty**, signed on 7 February 1992, and came into existence on 1 November 1993. Since then, the EU has progressively expanded its membership, with the latest member state joining in 2013. 

## History and Formation

The European Union can trace its origins back to the aftermath of World War II when the devastation of the continent spurred the need for economic and political cooperation. The EU was initially founded as the **European Coal and Steel Community** in 1951, with the aim of integrating the coal and steel industries of six countries. Subsequently, the Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the **European Economic Community (EEC)**. Over time, the EEC evolved into the EU we know today.

## Objectives and Principles

The European Union has several key objectives and principles that guide its functioning:

1. **Promote peace and security**: The EU was conceived to promote peace and stability in Europe after the devastation of the world wars. It aims to prevent conflicts among member states and beyond.
2. **Ensure economic prosperity**: The EU strives for the well-being of its citizens by creating a single market promoting free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor.
3. **Foster sustainable development**: The EU is committed to sustainable economic growth, social progress, and environmental protection.
4. **Promote democracy and human rights**: The EU promotes democratic values, human rights, and fundamental freedoms within its member states and globally.
5. **Ensure a common foreign and security policy**: The EU seeks to develop a common foreign and security policy, which encourages cooperation among member states on global issues.

## Institutions

To achieve its goals, the European Union has established several institutions that play different roles within the EU framework:

1. **European Commission**: The Commission acts as the EU's executive branch, proposing legislation, enforcing EU law, and representing the EU on the international stage.
2. **European Parliament**: The Parliament is the directly elected legislative body of the EU. It shares legislative power with the Council of the European Union and scrutinizes the Commission's work.
3. **Council of the European Union**: Also known as the Council of Ministers, it represents member states' governments and adopts legislative acts, together with the European Parliament.
4. **Court of Justice of the European Union**: The Court ensures the uniform interpretation and application of EU law. It resolves legal disputes between member states and implements EU legislation.
5. **European Central Bank**: The ECB is responsible for the monetary policy of the Eurozone. It oversees the Euro currency and aims to maintain price stability.
6. **European Council**: The Council consists of heads of state or government of EU member states. It sets the EU's political direction, defines priorities, and provides impetus for EU policy.

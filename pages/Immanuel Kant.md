Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) was a Prussian philosopher who is considered one of the most influential thinkers in Western philosophy. He is particularly known for his work in epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics. Kant's philosophy aimed to reconcile the rationalist and empiricist traditions and he proposed a new framework in which reason plays a central role in understanding the world.

## Early Life and Education ##
Immanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724, in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). He studied at the University of Königsberg, where he later became a professor of logic and metaphysics. Throughout his life, Kant rarely travelled far from his hometown, creating an image of a secluded philosopher known as the "Sage of Königsberg."

## Critique of Pure Reason ##
Kant's most famous work, *Critique of Pure Reason*, published in 1781, revolutionized Western philosophy. In this extensive treatise, Kant investigated the limits and scope of human knowledge, arguing that the mind actively organizes sensory input rather than passively receiving it. He introduced the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments and emphasized the role of reason and mathematics in understanding the natural world.

## Practical Philosophy ##
Besides his theoretical philosophy, Kant also made significant contributions to practical philosophy. In *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* (1785), he formulated the categorical imperative, a principle that serves as the foundation for moral reasoning and ethical decision-making. According to the categorical imperative, one should act only according to a maxim that could be willed to become a universal law.

## Legacy ##
Immanuel Kant's philosophy has had a profound impact on various disciplines, including philosophy, political theory, psychology, and anthropology. His ideas continue to shape contemporary debates and discussions. Notable philosophers who were influenced by Kant include Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Hans-Georg Gadamer.

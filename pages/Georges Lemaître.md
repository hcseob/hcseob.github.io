Georges Lemaître (1894-1966) was a Belgian Catholic priest, physicist, and astronomer who is best known for his proposal of the theory of the expansion of the universe, widely known as the Big Bang theory. His groundbreaking work on the cosmological constant and his mathematical formulation of an expanding universe laid the foundation for modern cosmology.

## Early Life and Education

Georges Henri Joseph Édouard Lemaître was born on July 17, 1894, in Charleroi, Belgium. He showed an early aptitude for mathematics and science and decided to pursue a career in these fields. Lemaître studied engineering at the Catholic University of Leuven, where he also became interested in physics and astronomy.

After completing his master's degree in engineering, Lemaître obtained a scholarship to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States. There, he had the opportunity to work with renowned physicists such as Arthur Eddington and Edwin Hubble.

## Scientific Contributions

### The Expanding Universe

It was during his time at MIT that Lemaître developed his groundbreaking theory of the expanding universe, later known as the Big Bang theory. In 1927, Lemaître published a paper in which he proposed that the universe was not static but rather undergoing expansion. He derived a relationship between the distance to galaxies and their redshift, which was later confirmed by the observational work of Edwin Hubble.

### Cosmological Constant

Lemaître's work on the cosmological constant, a term introduced by Albert Einstein in his general theory of relativity to account for a static and non-expanding universe, was also significant. Lemaître showed that the cosmological constant was unnecessary if the universe was expanding, as he had proposed. His findings challenged the prevailing notion of a static universe and laid the groundwork for Einstein to revise his own cosmological views.

### Lemaître's Equation

In addition to his theoretical contributions, Lemaître developed mathematical equations describing the relationship between the distance and velocity of galaxies to further support his theory of the expanding universe. Known as Lemaître's equation, it served as a foundation for future cosmological research.

## Religious Life

While pursuing his scientific career, Lemaître also studied theology and became ordained as a Catholic priest in 1923. He did not see a conflict between his scientific and religious beliefs and often emphasized the complementary nature of science and faith. Lemaître's religious convictions influenced his view of the Big Bang theory as a moment of creation, often referred to as the "Primeval Atom."

## Legacy and Recognition

Georges Lemaître's groundbreaking work on the expansion of the universe and the formulation of the Big Bang theory revolutionized our understanding of cosmology. His ideas provided the basis for further research and confirmed the scientific consensus that the universe had a definite beginning.

Lemaître's contributions were recognized and honored throughout his lifetime and after his death. He received numerous awards and honors, including the Eddington Medal (such as Eddington himself) and the Franklin Medal, among others. Lemaître's legacy lives on not only in the field of cosmology but also in the recognition of the compatibility between science and religion.

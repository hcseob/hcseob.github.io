Information Literacy refers to the skills and abilities required to navigate and evaluate information effectively in a digital age. It emphasizes the importance of critically assessing information sources, understanding their reliability, and using them ethically. Information literacy is crucial in enabling individuals to become informed and engaged citizens, as well as successful learners in today's information-driven society.

## Overview

Information literacy encompasses a wide range of competencies related to accessing, evaluating, and using information. It involves the ability to identify information needs, locate relevant resources, evaluate their credibility and accuracy, and effectively use the information for a specific purpose. Furthermore, it emphasizes ethical considerations such as respecting copyright, intellectual property rights, and providing appropriate citations.

In the digital age, where information is abundant and easily accessible through various platforms and technologies, information literacy has become more important than ever. With the proliferation of misinformation, fake news, and biased sources, it is essential for individuals to develop critical thinking and analysis skills to navigate the information landscape successfully.

## History

The concept of information literacy emerged in the 1970s as a response to the increasing availability and complexity of information. The American Library Association (ALA) played a significant role in defining and promoting information literacy through various initiatives. In 1989, the ALA Presidential Committee on Information Literacy released a landmark report titled "Information Literacy: A Neglected Core Competency." This report laid the foundation for the development of information literacy standards and frameworks globally.

Over the years, information literacy has evolved alongside advancements in technology and changes in information formats. From traditional print-based resources to digital materials and multimedia platforms, information literacy has adapted to encompass a broader range of skills required to effectively navigate and engage with information in a variety of formats.

## Key Components

Information literacy involves the ability to identify information needs, formulate effective search strategies, and retrieve information from diverse sources. It includes understanding various search tools, databases, and online catalogs to locate relevant resources efficiently.

### 2. Evaluation and Critical Thinking

Critical evaluation of information sources is a crucial element of information literacy. This component focuses on assessing the reliability, credibility, and relevance of information in various contexts. It involves examining the author's credentials, publication date, source of information, bias, and potential conflicts of interest.

### 3. Ethical Use of Information

Ethics play a vital role in information literacy. This component emphasizes the responsible and ethical use of information, including respecting copyright and intellectual property rights. It also involves providing accurate citations and avoiding plagiarism.

### 4. Information Synthesis and Communication

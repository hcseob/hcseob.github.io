**James Randi** (born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge; August 7, 1928 â€“ October 20, 2020) was a Canadian-American magician and skeptic who dedicated his life to debunking pseudoscience, paranormal claims, and faith healing.

## Early Life and Career

Randi was born on August 7, 1928, in Toronto, Canada. He began his career in show business as a magician, eventually adopting the stage name "The Amazing Randi." He gained fame for his remarkable escape acts and sleight of hand tricks. Randi also worked as a mentalist, convincingly simulating psychic powers to educate the public about the methods used by fraudulent psychics.

## Founding of the James Randi Educational Foundation

In 1996, Randi founded the **James Randi Educational Foundation** (JREF), a non-profit organization aimed at promoting critical thinking and scientific skepticism. The foundation sponsored a wide range of educational initiatives, including the annual *Amazing Meeting* (TAM), which brought together scientists, magicians, and skeptics to discuss skeptical and scientific topics.

## Debunking and Investigations

## Paranormal Challenge

One of Randi's most significant initiatives was the **One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge**. In 1964, he offered a cash prize of one million dollars to anyone who could demonstrate a paranormal ability under controlled scientific conditions. Despite numerous claims and challenges over the years, no one was able to successfully claim the prize.

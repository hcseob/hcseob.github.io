# Deontological Ethics

Deontological ethics, also known as duty-based ethics, is a moral theory that focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, rather than examining the consequences or outcomes of those actions. It derives its name from the Greek word "deon," which means duty or obligation. The fundamental principle guiding deontological ethics is that individuals have a moral duty to perform certain actions and refrain from others, regardless of the potential consequences.

## Origins and Influences

Deontological ethics trace their roots back to ancient Greek philosophy, particularly the works of the philosopher Immanuel Kant. Kant's moral theory, known as Kantian ethics, serves as the cornerstone of deontological ethics. According to Kant, individuals have a moral duty to act in a way that upholds moral principles, known as categorical imperatives. These imperatives are absolute and must be followed unconditionally.

## Key Principles

### Categorical Imperatives

Categorical imperatives are the central tenets of deontological ethics. They are universal moral principles that are applicable to all rational beings, regardless of context or personal desires. Kant proposed several formulations of categorical imperatives to guide ethical decision-making:

1. **Universalizability**: Act only on that maxim which you can at the same time will to become a universal law. In other words, act in a way that you would want everyone else to act under similar circumstances.
2. **Humanity as an End**: Treat humanity, whether in yourself or others, always as an end in itself and never merely as a means to an end. Respect individuals' intrinsic dignity and worth.

### Moral Rights and Duties

Deontological ethics emphasizes the existence of moral rights and duties. Moral rights are entitlements that individuals possess, which must be respected by others. Moral duties, on the other hand, are the obligations individuals have towards others in order to uphold these rights. 

## Criticisms

Deontological ethics have faced several criticisms, including:

1. **Rigidity**: Critics argue that the absolute nature of categorical imperatives can lead to inflexible decision-making, disregarding contextual factors.
2. **Conflicting Duties**: In situations where multiple moral duties come into conflict, deontological ethics may not provide clear guidance on how to resolve such conflicts.

# ZFC

Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (often abbreviated as ZFC) is a widely accepted foundational system of set theory in mathematics. Developed in the early 20th century by mathematicians Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel, ZFC provides a rigorous formalization of the concepts of sets and functions, serving as a basis for most of modern mathematics.

## History

ZFC is an extension of Zermelo set theory, which was introduced by Ernst Zermelo in the early 1900s. While the Zermelo set theory provided a foundation for much of mathematics, it eventually became clear that additional axioms were needed to address certain paradoxes and improve the theory's expressive power. In 1922, Abraham Fraenkel made significant contributions to modifying Zermelo set theory by introducing a new axiom, known as the axiom of replacement.

In 1928, Fraenkel, together with Thoralf Skolem, proved the consistency of Zermelo set theory with the axiom of replacement, paving the way for its acceptance as the foundation of modern mathematics. This expanded version of Zermelo set theory, now known as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, won a consensus among mathematicians due to its ability to avoid paradoxes and its natural formalization of the basic concepts of set theory.

## Axioms and Axiom of Choice

ZFC is formulated using a collection of nine axioms, which provide a consistent and rigorous framework for reasoning about sets. These axioms are:

1. **Axiom of Extensionality:** Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.
2. **Axiom of Regularity:** Every non-empty set A contains an element that is disjoint from A.
3. **Axiom Schema of Specification:** For any set A and any property P(x), there exists a set B containing precisely those elements x from A that satisfy P(x).
4. **Axiom of Pairing:** For any sets a and b, there exists a set that contains exactly a and b as its elements.
5. **Axiom of Union:** For any set A, there exists a set that contains all the elements of the sets that are members of A.
6. **Axiom Schema of Replacement:** If a function F(x,y) is defined for all sets x and y, then for any set A, the image of A under F is also a set.
7. **Axiom of Power Set:** For any set A, there exists a set that contains all possible subsets of A.
8. **Axiom of Infinity:** There exists a set that contains the natural numbers and satisfies certain properties.
9. **Axiom of Choice:** Given any collection of non-empty sets, there exists a function that selects exactly one element from each set.

The Axiom of Choice is often considered as the most controversial and non-intuitive axiom in ZFC. While it has powerful consequences and enables the development of various mathematical constructs, its unrestricted usage can lead to counterintuitive results, such as the Banach-Tarski paradox.

## Significance

ZFC serves as the foundation for most of modern mathematics and provides the language and tools to express and reason about mathematical concepts within set theory. It is used as a basis for mathematical proofs and enables the formal development of various branches of mathematics, including algebra, analysis, topology, and more.

The consistency of ZFC with other axiomatic systems, such as Peano arithmetic, second-order arithmetic, and higher-order logic, has been extensively studied and forms the basis for mathematical research. Extensions and modifications of ZFC, such as adding large cardinal axioms or studying inner models, have also been explored to enrich the scope and power of the theory.

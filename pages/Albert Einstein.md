Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity, one of the pillars of modern physics. His work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and had a profound impact on the scientific community.

## Early Life and Education

Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer, while his mother, Pauline Koch, ran the family household. At a young age, Einstein showed a keen interest in mathematics and physics, leading him to pursue a career in science.

After attending elementary and secondary schools in Munich, Einstein studied physics and mathematics at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland. He graduated in 1900 and obtained Swiss citizenship. During his studies, Einstein met his future wife, Mileva Marić, a fellow physics student. They married in 1903 and had two sons.

## Contributions to Physics

Einstein's groundbreaking scientific contributions began with his work at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, where he worked as a patent examiner from 1902 to 1909. During this time, he published several influential papers that laid the foundation for modern physics. In 1905, he published four articles in the journal Annalen der Physik, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, which covered various topics including the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and the special theory of relativity. These papers revolutionized the field and earned him international recognition.

In 1915, Einstein presented his theory of general relativity, which accounted for gravity as a geometric property of spacetime. This theory was proven correct when British astrophysicist Sir Arthur Eddington confirmed it during a total solar eclipse in 1919. Einstein's work on relativity transformed our understanding of the cosmos and paved the way for many scientific advancements, including the development of nuclear energy and the modern GPS system.

## Later Life and Legacy

In 1933, as Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany, Einstein left the country permanently due to his Jewish heritage and political views. He accepted a professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he spent the remainder of his career.

Throughout his life, Einstein was an outspoken advocate for pacifism, civil rights, and scientific freedom. He received numerous awards and honors, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Despite his fame, Einstein remained humble and often found solace in his love for classical music and sailing.

Albert Einstein passed away on 18 April 1955 at the age of 76. His contributions to science and humanity continue to be celebrated and revered. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest geniuses in the history of science, and his name has become synonymous with intellectual brilliance.

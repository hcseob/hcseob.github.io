Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. It is called "dark" because it does not interact with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, making it difficult to detect directly. Its existence was first proposed in the 1930s by Jan Oort, who noticed that the mass of visible matter in galaxies was not enough to account for the observed gravitational effects.

## Overview

Dark matter is believed to make up roughly 85% of the total matter in the universe, while the remaining 15% is composed of ordinary matter. Although dark matter has not been directly observed, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter and the cosmic microwave background radiation.

The exact nature of dark matter is still unknown, and several candidates have been proposed. One widely accepted hypothesis is that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which interact primarily through the weak nuclear force and gravity. Other possibilities include axions, sterile neutrinos, and primordial black holes.

## Observational Evidence

The existence of dark matter is supported by a wide range of astronomical observations. Some of the key pieces of evidence include:

1. Galaxy Rotation Curves: The rotational speeds of galaxies are much higher than what would be expected based on the visible matter alone. The presence of dark matter provides the additional gravitational pull needed to explain these observations.

2. Gravitational Lensing: Dark matter can bend light through gravitational lensing, causing distortions in the images of distant galaxies. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous galaxy clusters, providing further evidence for the existence of dark matter.

3. Cosmic Microwave Background: Detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation reveal subtle fluctuations that can be explained by the presence of dark matter. These measurements have played a crucial role in determining the composition of the universe.

4. Large-Scale Structure: The distribution of galaxies in the universe shows a filamentary pattern that can be explained by the gravitational effects of dark matter. Simulations incorporating dark matter accurately reproduce the observed large-scale structure.

## Dark Matter Experiments

Scientific efforts to directly detect dark matter particles have been ongoing for several decades. Various experiments have been designed to search for dark matter using a variety of detection techniques. These include:

- Underground experiments, such as the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) and the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, which search for interactions between dark matter particles and ordinary matter.

- Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), attempt to produce dark matter particles by colliding high-energy particles together.

- Space-based observatories, such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, search for indirect evidence of dark matter through the detection of high-energy gamma rays and antimatter particles.

While no direct detection of dark matter has been confirmed to date, ongoing experiments continue to push the boundaries of our understanding and refine our knowledge of the properties of dark matter.

## Theoretical Implications

The discovery of dark matter would have profound implications for our understanding of the universe. Its presence fundamentally changes our models of the cosmos, including the formation and evolution of galaxies, the distribution of matter on large scales, and the nature of the elusive dark energy.

Understanding the nature of dark matter is a major focus of modern astrophysics and particle physics. Researchers are continually refining their models and searching for new experimental evidence to shed light on this elusive component of the universe.

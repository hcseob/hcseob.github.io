# Pseudoscience

Pseudoscience refers to practices, beliefs, or theories that claim to be scientific but lack evidence, proper methodology, or plausibility within the scientific community. These concepts often appear to be scientific on the surface, employing scientific-sounding terminology and presenting themselves in a similar format to genuine scientific research. However, upon closer examination, they generally fail to meet the rigorous standards of scientific scrutiny.

## Characteristics

Pseudoscientific ideas frequently manifest certain characteristics that differentiate them from genuine scientific theories or fields of study:

1. **Lack of empirical evidence:** Pseudoscientific claims typically lack empirical evidence or rely on anecdotal evidence, personal testimonials, or cherry-picked data which are insufficient to support their validity.
2. **Absence of falsifiability:** Pseudoscience often fails to provide a means of testing or potentially disproving its claims. Genuine scientific theories must be falsifiable, meaning they can be tested and potentially proven false.
3. **Extreme resistance to change:** Pseudoscientific beliefs tend to resist alteration in response to new evidence. Genuine scientific theories evolve and adapt based on the accumulation of new data.
4. **Confirmation bias:** Pseudoscientific ideas often cherry-pick or selectively interpret evidence that supports their claims while disregarding contradictory findings.
5. **Lack of peer review:** Pseudoscientific claims often lack rigorous peer review by experts in the relevant fields. Peer review is a crucial aspect of scientific research, ensuring that studies meet established standards.
6. **Unsubstantiated claims of authority:** Pseudoscientific proponents may present themselves as experts or authorities without the necessary qualifications, bypassing the scientific community's peer review process.

## Examples

Numerous pseudoscientific disciplines and concepts exist, each with its own claims and controversies. Some well-known examples include:

- **[Astrology](Astrology.md):** Although astrology has ancient roots, it lacks empirical evidence to support its claims that celestial bodies and their positions affect human behavior and personality traits.
- **[Homeopathy](Homeopathy.md):** Homeopathy proposes that extremely diluted substances can cure ailments, despite inconsistent results in scientific studies and the lack of a plausible mechanism of action.
- **[Flat Earth Theory](Flat_Earth_Theory.md):** A modern pseudoscientific belief that disregards overwhelming evidence supporting the round Earth model established by centuries of scientific research.
- **[Creationism](Creationism.md):** An ideology that rejects evolutionary theory and asserts the biblical account of creation as accurate, despite substantial evidence supporting evolution.

## Critical Examination

The scientific community extensively critiques and scrutinizes pseudoscientific concepts, aiming to highlight the inconsistencies, lack of evidence, and fallacious arguments these ideas often present. Organizations and individuals focused on scientific skepticism, such as the **[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry](Committee_for_Skeptical_Inquiry.md)**, actively investigate and debunk pseudoscientific claims through scientific inquiry and rational thinking.

Furthermore, science education and critical thinking skills play a role in minimizing the influence of pseudoscientific ideas. Encouraging scientific literacy and promoting the scientific method aids society in distinguishing between genuine scientific claims and pseudoscience.

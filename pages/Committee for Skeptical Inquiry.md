# Committee for Skeptical Inquiry

The **Committee for Skeptical Inquiry** (CSI) is a nonprofit scientific and educational organization that promotes scientific skepticism and critical thinking. Founded in 1976, CSI supports the examination of controversial or extraordinary claims from a scientific and evidence-based perspective.

## History and Mission

The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry was originally established as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) in 1976. It was co-founded by Paul Kurtz, a philosopher and advocate of scientific skepticism. The organization changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry in 2006 to better reflect its broadened scope of inquiry.

The mission of CSI is to promote a scientific and rational approach to investigating and analyzing claims that depart from current scientific consensus. It seeks to provide the public with reliable and evidence-based information to help distinguish fact from fiction.

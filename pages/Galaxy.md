# Galaxy

A **galaxy** is a vast, gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. These components are held together by mutual gravitational attraction. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few million stars to giants with hundreds of billions of stars.

## History

The study of galaxies has significantly evolved over time. Until the early 20th century, people believed that our Milky Way galaxy encompassed the entire known universe. However, in the 1920s, American astronomer Edwin Hubble used the newly discovered relationship between a galaxy's distance and its velocity to determine that there are numerous galaxies beyond our own.

## Formation and Types

Galaxies are thought to have formed from the gravitational collapse of primordial gas clouds. The exact mechanisms behind galaxy formation are still not fully understood, but computer simulations and observations have provided some insights. 

There are three main types of galaxies:

1. **Elliptical Galaxies:** These are usually round or elliptical in shape and contain mostly older stars. They have less interstellar gas and dust, resulting in a lower rate of star formation.
2. **Spiral Galaxies:** Characterized by a distinct rotating disk with spiral arms, spiral galaxies often have a central bulge of stars. Our own Milky Way galaxy is a spiral galaxy.
3. **Irregular Galaxies:** These galaxies lack any definite shape or structure and are often undergoing active star formation. They can range from small dwarf irregular galaxies to larger examples with chaotic, fragmented profiles.

## Milky Way Galaxy

The Milky Way is the galaxy where our Solar System is located. It is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 100,000 light-years in diameter and contains an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars. Its distinct spiral arms are formed by density waves of stars and other matter.

## Observational Techniques

Astronomers use various techniques to study galaxies:

- **Photometry and Spectroscopy:** These methods involve analyzing the light emitted by galaxies to gather information about their composition, temperature, and motion.
- **Radio Astronomy:** Radio telescopes allow scientists to observe the radio emissions from galaxies. This technique helps identify and study various celestial phenomena, such as quasars and radio galaxies.
- **Gravitational Lensing:** The bending of light due to massive objects' gravitational pull helps researchers study the properties of distant galaxies.
- **Redshift Measurements:** By analyzing the redshift of light emitted by galaxies, astronomers can determine their distance from Earth and study the expansion of the universe.

## Notable Examples

- **Andromeda Galaxy:** The closest major galaxy to the Milky Way, visible as a faint smudge in the night sky.
- **Whirlpool Galaxy (M51):** A stunning spiral galaxy located approximately 23 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici.
- **Sombrero Galaxy (M104):** Known for its distinctive shape resembling a sombrero hat, it is located approximately 29 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo.

## Conclusion

Galaxies are captivating cosmic structures that provide insights into the vastness and complexity of our universe. The study of galaxies continues to expand our knowledge and understanding of the cosmos, shedding light on fundamental questions about the origins and evolution of our own galaxy and the entire universe.

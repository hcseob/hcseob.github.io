Consequentialism is a moral theory that determines the morality of an action based on its consequences. According to consequentialism, the rightness or wrongness of an action depends solely on the outcome or consequences it produces. This ethical perspective stands in contrast to other moral theories that focus on the intrinsic nature of an action or the intentions behind it.

## History

The roots of consequentialism can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy. Philosophers such as Epicurus, Aristippus, and the Cynics emphasized the importance of happiness, pleasure, and the pursuit of the good life. However, it was not until the 18th century that consequentialism became a well-articulated moral theory.

## Utilitarianism as a Form of Consequentialism

The most well-known form of consequentialism is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism, developed by Jeremy Bentham and later refined by John Stuart Mill, argues that the moral worth of an action is determined by its contribution to overall happiness or utility. According to utilitarianism, the morally right action is the one that maximizes happiness or minimizes suffering for the greatest number of people.

## Act Consequentialism vs. Rule Consequentialism

Consequentialism can be further divided into two main categories: act consequentialism and rule consequentialism. 

**Act consequentialism** requires individuals to assess the consequences of each individual action and choose the one that produces the best outcomes. This approach focuses on evaluating the immediate effects of a specific action.

**Rule consequentialism**, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of following general rules or principles that, if widely implemented, would yield the best overall consequences. Rule consequentialists argue that adherence to certain rules, even if they may not maximize happiness in every individual case, leads to better overall outcomes in the long run.

## Criticisms

Critics of consequentialism argue that it can sometimes lead to morally questionable actions. For instance, if the greatest amount of overall happiness is achieved by sacrificing the well-being of a minority, consequentialism might justify such actions. Additionally, evaluating the consequences of an action can be complex and uncertain, making it challenging to determine what course of action will actually lead to the best outcomes.

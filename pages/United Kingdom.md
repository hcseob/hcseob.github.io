The **United Kingdom (UK)**, officially known as the **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland**, is a sovereign country located off the northwestern coast of mainland Europe. It encompasses four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and has a total area of approximately 93,628 square miles (242,500 square kilometers).

## Etymology

The term "United Kingdom" refers to the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain (which included England and Scotland) and the Kingdom of Ireland under the Act of Union in 1801. Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, the country was officially renamed to its current title, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

## History

The history of the United Kingdom spans thousands of years, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Palaeolithic era. The region that became the UK was conquered by the Romans in AD 43, who established the province of Britannia. Over the centuries, various kingdoms emerged on the island, including the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Scotland, and the Kingdom of Ireland.

The union between England and Scotland, known as the Kingdom of Great Britain, was established in 1707. The Act of Union in 1801 added Ireland to the union, creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. However, following the Irish War of Independence, Ireland seceded from the union in 1922, leading to the establishment of Northern Ireland.

The UK has played a significant role in shaping world history, from its colonial expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries to its involvement in both World Wars. It was one of the founding members of the United Nations and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

Fritz Jahr (5 October 1895 – 17 October 1953) was a German Protestant pastor, theologian, and educator, known for his contributions to the development of bioethics. He is regarded as one of the pioneers in the field of bioethics and environmental ethics.

## Early Life and Education

Fritz Jahr was born on October 5, 1895, in Osnabrück, Germany. He studied theology at the University of Tübingen and later at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. During his studies, Jahr developed an interest in philosophy and ethics, which would shape his future work.

## Career

### Bioethical Contributions

Jahr's most notable contribution to the field of ethics came in 1927 when he coined the term "bioethics" in an article titled "Bio-Ethik: Eine Umschau über die ethischen Beziehungen des Menschen zu Tier und Pflanze" (Bio-Ethics: A Survey of the Ethical Relationships of Humans to Animals and Plants). This groundbreaking article laid the foundation for the development of bioethics as a distinct field of study.

In the article, Jahr highlighted the importance of considering ethical issues concerning life and health, not just from a human perspective but also in relation to animals and the environment. He proposed the establishment of a new discipline that would explore the ethical dimensions of life sciences and their reverberations in society.

### Educator and Pastor

Jahr worked as a pastor, primarily in the German cities of Hannover and Tübingen, as well as in the Netherlands. He was a firm believer in the importance of ethical education and used his pastoral role to promote ethical discussions and raise awareness about environmental and health issues.

Additionally, Jahr served as an educator and lecturer. He taught practical theology and ethics at various institutions, including the Evangelical Academy in Wittenberg.

## Legacy

Fritz Jahr's pioneering work in bioethics and his instrumental role in introducing the term "bioethics" have had a lasting impact on the field. His ideas and concepts have influenced subsequent generations of bioethicists and continue to shape the ethical debates surrounding the life sciences.

Today, bioethics has emerged as an interdisciplinary field at the junction of medicine, biology, philosophy, and law. It addresses a wide range of ethical issues, including but not limited to medical research, genetic engineering, end-of-life decisions, and environmental sustainability.
